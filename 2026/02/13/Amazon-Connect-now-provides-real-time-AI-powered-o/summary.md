## 要約

Amazon Connect now provides AI-powered Task overviews with suggested next actions so agents can understand work items faster and resolve them more quickly.

## 詳細

When an agent receives a Task to process a refund request submitted through an online form, Amazon Connect summarizes earlier activities such as verifying order details, checking return eligibility, and confirming the payment method, and then presents recommended next steps to complete the refund. To enable this feature, add the Connect assistant flow block to your flows before a Task contact is assigned to your agent. You can guide the recommendations of your generative AI-powered Tasks assistant by adding knowledge bases. This new feature is available in all AWS regions where Amazon Connect real time agent assistance is available.
